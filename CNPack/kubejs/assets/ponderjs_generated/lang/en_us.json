  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.header": "Spawn-Busting With The Brazier",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_1": "The Brazier is a Multiblock structure used to prevent monsters from spawning in a large radius around it.",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_10": "So let\u0027s make it taller to increase that!",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_11": "Now it\u0027ll stop spawns in a larger radius!",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_12": "To be exact, it\u0027ll get a circular radius increase of 10 Blocks per layer.",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_13": "And the limit for its height is 10 Layers, which is a whopping 100 Block radius!",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_2": "Let\u0027s start by going over how to build its structure.",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_3": "The Brazier has two categories of Blocks that are used for its structure.",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_4": "The \"Stripe\" Blocks, which can be Ancient Debris or Netherite Blocks...",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_5": "... and the \"Base\" Blocks, which can be Gilded Blackstone or Crying Obsidian",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_6": "The Stripes go in Cardinal directions from the center, as seen.",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_7": "While the Bases cover everything else, except the corners, those are ignored.",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_8": "Once the Brazier lights, that means it\u0027s active!",
  "kubejs.ponder.brazier.text_9": "... But it\u0027ll have a pretty limited range like this...",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.header": "Casting from The Smeltery",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_1": "A Seared Drain is where the Fluids inside of the Smeltery can be interfaced with.",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_10": "Applying a Redstone Signal to a Faucet will cause it to begin casting.",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_11": "This sequence has been accelerated for your viewing pleasure.",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_12": "As long as Redstone is still applied when the Casted Item is removed, the Faucet will continue Casting.",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_2": "The most common way to extract them is a Seared Faucet.",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_3": "Seared Faucets can pour Fluids from the Smeltery into things placed beneath them.",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_4": "Most Importantly, Casting Tables and Basins.",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_5": "Casting Tables are most often used to cast Ingots and Tool Parts from Molten Metals in the Smeltery.",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_6": "While Casting Basins are often used to cast Blocks from Metals in the Smeltery.",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_7": "Casting Tables often require a Cast for Molten fluids to Cool in.",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_8": "To Pour Fluids out of a Seared Faucet, simply Interact with it",
  "kubejs.ponder.casting.text_9": "Casting can also be automated from Faucets using Redstone.",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_fission.header": "Fission Reactor [WIP]",

  "kubejs.ponder.mek_fusion.header": "Fusion Reactor [WIP]",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_fusion.text_1": "So, you want to build a Fusion Reactor to get all the energy in the world?",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_fusion.text_2": "We\u0027ll start by getting down the Building rules with the Bottom layer.",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_fusion.text_3": "A Fusion Reactor can be made of any combination of Fusion Reactor Casing, Ports, Logic Adapters, Laser Focus Matrixes and Reactor Glass.",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.header": "The Supercritical Phase Shifter",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.text_1": "The Supercritical Phase Shifter is a Multiblock used to create Antimatter.",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.text_10": "Supercharged Coils do not need to be placed on the Walls, nor be aligned with the center of the Structure.",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.text_11": "Now all you need to do is pipe in your Polonium, provide a load of Energy, and get out your Antimatter!",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.text_2": "Let\u0027s start by making the Bottom layer.",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.text_3": "The SPS can be made of any combination of SPS Casing, Ports, and Structural Glass",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.text_4": "However, the Edges must be composed of only SPS Casing.",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.text_5": "A Configurator can be used to change a Port\u0027s mode",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.text_6": "The other Sides of the structure follow the same rules as the Bottom.",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.text_7": "Now, Let\u0027s move on to those sides, and other mechanics of the SPS.",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.text_8": "Supercharged Coils must be placed on a Port to let it accept Energy.",
  "kubejs.ponder.mek_sps.text_9": "Ports with Supercharged Coils attached can still be used to Input and Output Chemical products.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.header": "The Smeltery and Melting",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_1": "So, you want to build a Smeltery to Melt things down and Cast them out? Then let\u0027s go over the basics.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_10": "As for the Smeltery\u0027s main purpose, Melting items down.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_11": "You can add items to melt either through the Smeltery Controller\u0027s interface, physically dropping them inside of it, or feeding them in through a Seared Chute",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_12": "...Oh yeah, it\u0027ll also need some kind of Fuel to heat up the contents.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_13": "Lava is your first available Fuel for it.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_14": "Presto, Molten Copper!",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_15": "The Smeltery\u0027s height can also be increased by adding more Layers.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_16": "This will increase its Capacity for Fluids and Items, but cause it to consume Fuel faster.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_2": "The Smeltery is composed primarily of different Seared Blocks.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_3": "First, the Bottom layer of it can be any Rectangular shape, and must be made of any regular Seared block.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_4": "We\u0027ll use a 3x3 base in this example.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_5": "Higher layers of the Smeltery can use other Seared blocks.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_6": "Most importantly, the Smeltery Controller.",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_7": "Every Smeltery requires a Smeltery Controller...",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_8": "...some kind of Seared Tank...",
  "kubejs.ponder.smeltery.text_9": "...and atleast one Seared Drain to access its contents.",
  "kubejs.ponder.vampire_portal.header": "Portal to The Vampire Forest",
  "kubejs.ponder.vampire_portal.text_1": "Looking for a Vampire Forest? It\u0027s contained solely within a custom Dimension in MC Eternal 2.",
  "kubejs.ponder.vampire_portal.text_2": "Here\u0027s how to reach it.",
  "kubejs.ponder.vampire_portal.text_3": "First, create a ring of Deepslate Bricks.",
  "kubejs.ponder.vampire_portal.text_4": "Then, use either a full Blood Bottle or Vampire Blood on each brick.",
  "kubejs.ponder.vampire_portal.text_5": "Then, just click anywhere inside the frame with Vampire Blood!"
